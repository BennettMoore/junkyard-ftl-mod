# junkyard-ftl-mod
A mod for FTL based around Reducing, Reusing, and Recycling

## Requirements
In order to run this mod properly, you must also be using the [Hyperspace mod](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=35095), as this is used to allow for custom crew and ships to work.

It is recommended that you use the [Slipstream Mod Manager](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=17102) to load this mod, though any mod loader should work.

## Installation
For stable versions of this mod, there should be a .ftl file that can be simply pasted into your mods folder, but if you want to play a version that is WIP, the .ftl file may not always be up-to-date. Listed below are instructions on how to ensure you are using the most recent mod files:

1. Select the **data** and **img** directories and compress them into a .zip file
2. Rename the .zip file to **Junkyard.ftl**
3. Place the newly created .ftl file into your mods folder

## Roadmap

## Contributing
Although I do not mind people pulling my code and playing around with it, this is strictly a personal project, so unless I really like your addition I will probably not be inclined to merge it into my own code.
